\maketitle

I'm a product-oriented engineer with experience in logistics, investment and data analysis projects. Diversity of roles and environments, as I believe, makes you a better leader and that's one of my main objectives.

Tooling of choice I have experience with is Node, Ruby, Rails, Java, Spring, Hibernate, Oracle DB, MySQL, MongoDB, AWS, Bash, Git and sometimes Excel. Contributed to Apache Software Foundation projects.

I'm also interested on the applications of Cognitive Psychology and AI, specially in (serious) games.
