\maketitle

A \textbf{Game Designer} and \textbf{Tools Developer} with a \textbf{diverse professional experience} in the fields of finance, data analysis, machine learning and web development. 

My main game development experience is with the \textbf{Unreal Engine}. Due to my gamedev work I had to jump into different disciplines to support the team, and so I had to learn on the fly basic animation, 3D modelling and shading, VFX, and sound design, as needed. I also have some knowledge of \textbf{Unity} and have worked with some general purpose programming languages including \textbf{C++}, \textbf{JavaScript} and \textbf{Java}.
