\maketitle

A product-oriented \textit{Technical Game Designer} with a diverse professional experience in multiple fields such as finance, data analysis, machine learning and web development. 

My main interests are the applications of psychology and AI, specially in game design and intelligent game systems.

I have experience with the \textbf{Unreal Engine} for game development, having used software such as \textbf{git}, \textbf{Maya}, \textbf{Mixamo}, and \textbf{Adobe Audition} to create needed assets for the games I made. I also know a bit of \textbf{Unity} and some general purpose programming languages such as \textbf{C++}, \textbf{Ruby}, \textbf{JavaScript} and \textbf{Java}.

(Updated: \today)

\section{Qualities}
\cvline{}{Strong analytical, problem-solving and communication skills}
\cvline{}{Eager to learn and develop new skills according to project's necessities, quick to adapt to new situations}
\cvline{}{Experience in design, programming and project management techniques and tools}
\cvline{}{Worked in different parts of Spain, Luxembourg and Great Britain}

\section{Experience}
\cventry{Today \\ Sep 2016}{Independent Game Designer and Developer}{}{}{}{Currently developing casual arcade games as a Technical Game Designer within a team of 14 people since January 2018. Here's a small showcase of my work during this period:\vspace{0.25cm}\\
{\large \textbf{\textit{Darkborn}}} \\
A single player fast-paced \textbf{Hack\&Slash} based around a playstyle switch mechanic: \url{http://bit.ly/darkborn-demo}, code samples on request \\
Worked as the technical go-to person for the design team, developed the concept and core gameplay mechanics using mostly prototyping methods (UE4 Blueprints and C++). Main responsible for the game's sound design. \\
Also contributed prototypes and tweaks for animation and VFX reference in-engine. \\ 		
Team composed of 5 designers, 5 artists and 6 programmers. Capstone project for MsC Game Design @ U-Tad.\vspace{0.25cm}\\
%
{\large \textbf{\textit{A Fireball for your Friends}}} \\
A \textbf{combat} prototype for an online multiplayer $3^{rd}$ person \textbf{magic duel game} with a focus on customization: \url{http://bit.ly/fireball-prototype}, code at GitHub: \url{http://bit.ly/fireball-code} \\
	Built by myself on my free time (January 2018). Created a spell system with the objective of fast and easy iteration, a sample level, and a very tough enemy AI using only UE4 Blueprints and free assets from the UE4 store.\vspace{0.25cm}\\
%
{\large \textbf{\textit{Wrong Side - A TF2 CTF Level}}} \\
A Team Fortress 2 level focused on being fun on small servers (small number of players): \url{http://bit.ly/wrong-side} \\
	Built by myself on my free time (February 2018) in 2 weeks without prior knowledge of the Source engine.

\cventry{Sep 2016\\May 2011}{Software Engineer}{Multiple Companies}{}{}{Worked for the banking, logistics and ecommerce, machine learning research, business intelligence industries. \\ 
Developed mostly webpages, but also proof-of-concept systems for research and analytics systems. \\
Lead and coached junior team members. \\
Also contributed to a number of Open Source projects (http://bit.ly/pedros-github).
