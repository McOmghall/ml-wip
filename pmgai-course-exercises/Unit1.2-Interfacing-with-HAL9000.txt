Interfacing with HAL9000
========================

----

External Data vs. Internal Memory
=================================

* Internal Memory

    - Human inputs into the console. Useful for tracking and making informed decisions about human psyche.

* External Data

    - Everything else: ship state, human position...

----

Push vs. Pull
=============

* Polling

    - Everytime the human inputs stuff in the console, read it, respond in real time.

* Events

    - Human enters a room, human operates ship controls, human tries to turn on lights after shutdown...
