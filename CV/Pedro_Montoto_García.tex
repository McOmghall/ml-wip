\section{Experience}
\cventry{Today \\ Sep 2016}{Independent Game Designer and Developer}{}{}{}{Currently developing casual arcade games as a Technical Game Designer within a team of 14 people since January 2018. Here is a small showcase of my work during this period:\vspace{0.25cm}\\
{\large \textbf{\textit{Darkborn}}} \\
\url{http://bit.ly/darkborn-demo} (Can send source code on request). \\
A single player fast-paced \textbf{Hack\&Slash} built around a playstyle switch mechanic. \\
Worked as the technical go-to person for the design team, developed the concept and core gameplay mechanics using mainly prototyping methods (UE4 Blueprints and C++). \\
Main responsible for the sound design of the game. \\
Also contributed prototypes and tweaks for animation and VFX reference in-engine. \\ 		
Team composed of 5 designers, 5 artists and 6 programmers. Capstone project for MsC Game Design @ U-Tad.\vspace{0.25cm}\\
%
{\large \textbf{\textit{A Fireball for your Friends}}} \\
\url{http://bit.ly/fireball-prototype} (Source: \url{http://bit.ly/fireball-code}) \\
A \textbf{combat} prototype for an online multiplayer $3^{rd}$ person \textbf{magic duel game} with a focus on customization \\
	Built by myself on my free time (January 2018). Created a spell system with the objective of fast and easy iteration, a sample level, and a very tough enemy AI using only UE4 Blueprints and free assets from the UE4 store.\vspace{0.25cm}\\
%
{\large \textbf{\textit{Wrong Side - A TF2 CTF Level}}} \\
\url{http://bit.ly/wrong-side} \\
A Team Fortress 2 level focused on being fun on small servers (small number of players) \\
	Built by myself on my free time (February 2018) in 2 weeks without prior knowledge of the Source engine.
